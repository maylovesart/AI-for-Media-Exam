# AI-for-Media-Exam

**Project Overview**
This project explores the application of artificial intelligence in media, focusing on reimagining UK Black icons using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The main subject of the study is Diane Abbott, the first Black woman elected to the British Parliament.

**Key Features**
Initial exploration using CNNs for image classification and feature extraction
Transition to GANs for generating novel artistic representations
Implementation of a GAN architecture using TensorFlow
Training on a dataset of Diane Abbott images and Richard Stone's paintings
Experimentation with style transfer to incorporate elements of Richard Stone's portrait style

**Methodology**
Data collection and preprocessing of images
CNN implementation for initial feature extraction and style exploration
GAN architecture design and implementation
Training the GAN using Google Colab's GPU resources
Analysis of generated images and training progress over 500+ epochs

**Results**
The project demonstrates the potential and challenges of using AI for artistic reinterpretation of cultural icons. While not achieving perfect photorealism, the GAN-generated images show progression in capturing Diane Abbott's likeness with elements of Richard Stone's artistic style.

**Ethical Considerations**
The project addresses important ethical questions regarding consent, artistic integrity, potential misuse of AI-generated images, and the importance of diverse datasets in AI training.

**In this repo you will find:**

- Three iterations of my experimentation codes
- Images that I gathered to train the model on
